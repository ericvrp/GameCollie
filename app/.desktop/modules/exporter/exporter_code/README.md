# GameCollie
GameCollie keeps track of all your game collection needs

This code is very much work in progress.
You can use it at your own risk by doing...

	# Install a recent NodeJS from https://nodejs.org
	# edit settings.json
	npm install
	node GameCollie.js

notes:
	- This code is tested on OSX only for now!!
	- the scraper from https://github.com/sselph/scraper/releases generates gamelist.xml files in the desired format.
	- https://github.com/sselph/scraper/wiki/Supported-Platforms
	- per platform folder run:
		scraper -thumb_only -append -add_not_found -workers 10

"Let the games begin!"
