# GameCollie
GameCollie keeps track of all your game collection needs

This code is very much work in progress.
You can use it at your own risk by doing...

	# Install a recent NodeJS from https://nodejs.org
	npm install
	node indexer.js # from a local directory with your games collection

notes:
	- This code is tested on OSX only for now!!

"Let the games begin!"
