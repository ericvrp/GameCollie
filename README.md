GameCollie keeps track of all your game collection needs

Currently this projects consists of three parts.
What is written here is not all fact yet but definitely what we aim for.

app) a web front and backend that tries to know about all games ever created.
		 This is where you keep track of the metadata of your collection(s).
		 Content editing will be decentralized by using blockchain technology.
		 To use GameCollie you need not know the details of this but is very cool nonetheless. And if that is not enough GameCollie contains some clever
		 AI (deep neural networks) to make suggestions about nice games to play.
		 When you own a game and a friend would like to lend it you can share it.
		 When the user opts-in we hope to collect large amounts of data about what
		 games work on certain emulators or devices. This will make you gameplay
		 time even more enjoyable!

indexer) is what will scan/scrape your (local) collection files.
		The result will be visible in the append

exporter) contains the code to export the best games to your gaming devices.
		All according to you personal preferences of course. GameCollie is here to serve!
